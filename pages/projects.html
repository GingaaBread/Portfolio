                            Pick a language, decide which module you would like to study, and take the quiz.
                            With several quiz types, a lot of course modules, and an exciting learning approach,
                            studying a language has never been more fun.

                            In this project, I really want to build a Duolingo-esque language learning platform,
                            which on one hand served as a way to reinforce my backend skills, and on the other
                            my attempt at learning Italian. On the front end, I wanted to challenge myself in this project, by not using
                            a JavaScript framework, and instead wrote the code in <strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong>, which helped me
                            dive deep into the Document Object Model. On the backend side, I used <strong>Node.js</strong> 
                            and <strong>Passport</strong> for the first time.

                            It is arguably every computer scientist's dream to build their own programming language.
                            This project got me one step closer as I could use it to specify the design of the language,
                            and manually create a wiki-like documentation web application, for the first time. 
                            The highlight (badum-ts) of the web app is arguably the syntax highlighter for my language.
