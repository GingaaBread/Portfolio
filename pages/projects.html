                            my interest in web development
                            by finally making use of the <strong>Java Spring</strong> framework. On the front-end side,
                            it also allowed
                            my to get introduced to <strong>PrimeVue</strong>, a <strong>Vue</strong> component
                            library, which I've quickly learnt to appreciate for its simplicity and elegance.

                            project, by not using
                            a JavaScript framework, and instead wrote the code in <strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong>,
                            which helped me
                            dive deep into the Document Object Model. On the backend side, I used
                            <strong>Node.js</strong>

                            It is arguably every computer scientist's dream to build their own programming language.
                            This project got me one step closer as I could use it to specify the design of the language,
                            and manually create a wiki-like documentation web application, for the first time.
                            The highlight (badum-ts) of the web app is arguably the syntax highlighter for my language.

                            This Strategy Farm-Sim Card Game was my biggest team leading role to date.
                            In total, I was the lead of a team of 12 other developers, ranging from Programmers to Sound
                            Designers to UI Artists.
                            As the team lead, it was my primary job to get us all working as efficiently as possible,
                            ensure that the game would be delivered on-time,
                            and help every individual developer with their problems and demands.
                            At the same time, I also took on the roles of the Scrum Master and Product Owner. Using
                            Scrum as our agile productivity framework,
                            it made sense to merge these two roles into one; I would manage the backlogs, lead the Scrum
                            meetings, etc.
